        "goal": "Freedom to determine one's own actions.",
        "personal-motivation": "It is important to make own decisions about life, being independent and having the freedom to choose. The focus of this value in contrast to the 'self-direction: thought' aspect is to determine an action, rather than a conviction or thought."

        "personal-motivation": "Being ambitious, successful and being admired for achievements and skills.  Demonstrating competence according to social standards or in competition. Important dimension of achievement is that it is perceived within the social standards, and according to the rules of engagement, unlike as for the value of power.

        "personal-motivation": "Having lots of money for the power it brings, being wealthy, and pursue social status. This value is not automatically present when terms like budgets, costs, or growth appear in a sentence. Such terms refer to the value only if they make up an essential part of a sentence and are expressed as an important part of decision making with an underlying motivation or justification. For example, when someone is writing about the 'huge', 'large', 'out of control' costs, or in any other way mentioned as important argument. Finally, in contrast to the value of 'achievement', it only focuses on resource matters not on performance."

        "personal-motivation": "Avoid dangerous situations, value personal security and safety, live in a secure environment, have a secured income, being healthy. Similar to the difference between 'benevolence' and 'universalism: concern', the decisive difference between 'security: personal' and 'security: societal' is to whom the value refers. In case of individuals, family and friends, it is personal, e.g., if someone writes in first-person about their own health. In contrast, when it is applied to any group or society as a whole, it is societal. Thus, 'security: personal' will most likely not appear often in the text only if speaking of individual experiences."

        "personal-motivation": "Help and care about close ones, be responsive to family and friends. Actively helping and taking care of someone close. A key difference between 'benevolence: caring' and 'benevolence: dependability' is that the caring dimension is active about doing something, while the dependability is more about the perception of being there for someone, being trustworthy etc. Furthermore, caring here is not generic or universal, it is limited to specific persons or a delineated in-group within a person’s immediate environment. This last aspect distinguishes 'benevolence: caring' from 'universalism: concern'. Similar to the two sides of security, the decisive difference between 'benevolence: caring' and 'universalism: concern' is to whom the value refers. In case of individuals, family, and friends, it is 'benevolence: caring'. In contrast, when it is applied to any social group or people in general, it is 'universalism: concern'. Thus, 'benevolence: caring' will most likely not appear often in the text only if speaking of individual experiences."

Be seen as reliable, others should have confidence in you helping close ones. A key difference between 'benevolence' and 'universalism' is that 'benevolence' is primarily targeted towards close ones, and not towards strangers. In line with 'security: personal', close ones are family and friends, not the larger public."

        "goal": "Commitment to equality, justice, and protection for all people.",
        "personal-motivation": "Protecting the weak and vulnerable, care about equal opportunities, treat everyone justly. In contrast to the value of 'security: societal', protection and caring also goes beyond society boundaries. It is more generic referring to all kinds of people/groups. Moreover, 'universalism: concern' focuses more on caring, protecting, promoting well-being, especially of vulnerable people from a motivation of 'empathy', 'helping' or 'a universal justice perspective', whereas 'security: societal' focuses on protecting, promoting well-being more from a motivation of 'preventing', 'averting', 'ending' dangers or threats and 'preserving' security and stability."
