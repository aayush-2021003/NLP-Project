# Abstract
Human Value Detection, which is Task 4 for SemEval 2023, aims to predict the human values from a set of 20 value categories in a given argument. The nuanced, implicit, and often subjective nature of value categories in textual arguments makes this a difficult task. The slightly small size of the dataset and lack of label awareness add an added challenge. To address these challenges we propose a model which draws on Textual Entailment and Contrastive Learning. The model achieves an F1 score of 0.5681, which beats the best submission in SemEval 23.
